<h2>ELF linker sets</h2>

<p>The linker takes collections of definitions, separates them into
different sections (e.g. code and data), and concatenates each section
into a contiguous block of memory. The effect is that although you can
interleave code and data in your C source file, the linker
disentangles the little pieces into one code section and one data
section.

<p>You can also define your own sections, if you like, by using gcc
declaration attributes, so the linker will gather the declarations
together in your binary regardless of how spread out they were in the
source. The FreeBSD kernel calls these
&quot;<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/sys/sys/linker_set.h?view=markup">linker
sets</a>&quot; and uses them extensively to construct lists of
drivers, initialization actions, etc.

<p>This allows us to declare the metadata for a FizzBuzz predicate
alongside its function definition, and use the linker to gather all
the metadata into the array expected by the main program. The key
part of the macro below is the <tt>__attribute__((section("pred")))</tt>.

<pre>
    #define predicate(name, test) \
        static bool name(int i) { return test; } \
        pred pred_##name __attribute__((section("pred"))) \
            = { name, #name }
</pre>

<p>With that convenience macro we can define our predicates in
whatever order or in whatever files we want.

<pre>
    predicate(Fizz, i % 3 == 0);
    predicate(Buzz, i % 5 == 0);
</pre>

<p>To access the metadata, the linker helpfully defines some symbols
identifying the start and end of the section, which we can pass to our
main program.

<pre>
    extern pred __start_pred[], __stop_pred[];
    
    #define ptbl    __start_pred
    #define ptbl_end __stop_pred
</pre>
