<h1>FizzBuzz with higher-order cpp macros and ELF linker sets</h1>

<p>Here are a couple of fun ways to reduce repetitive code in C.
To illustrate them, I'll implement FizzBuzz with the constraint
that I must mention Fizz and Buzz only once in each implementation.

<p>The generic context is that I want to declare some functions, and
each function has an object containing some metadata. In this case the
function is a predicate like &quot;divisible by three&quot; and the
metadata is &quot;Fizz&quot;. In a more realistic situation the
function might be a driver entry point and the metadata might be a
description of the hardware it supports.

<p>Both implementations of FizzBuzz fit into the following generic
FizzBuzz framework, which knows the general form of the game but not
the specific rules about when to utter silly words instead of numbers.

<pre>
    #include &lt;stdbool.h>
    #include &lt;stdio.h>
    #include &lt;err.h>
    
    // predicate metadata
    typedef struct pred {
        bool (*pred)(int);
        const char *name;
    } pred;
    
    // some other file declares a table of predicates
    #include PTBL
    
    static bool putsafe(const char *s) {
        return s != NULL && fputs(s, stdout) != EOF;
    }
    
    int main(void) {
        for (int i = 0; true; i++) {
            bool done = false;
            // if a predicate is true, print its name
            for (pred *p = ptbl; p &lt; ptbl_end; p++)
                done |= putsafe(p->pred(i) ? p->name : NULL);
            // if no predicate was true, print the number
            if (printf(done ? "\n" : "%d\n", i) &lt; 0)
                err(1, "printf");
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>To compile this code you need to define the PTBL macro to the name
of a file that implements a FizzBuzz predicate table.
