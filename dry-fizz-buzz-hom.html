<h2>Higher-order cpp macros</h2>

<p>A higher-order macro is a macro which takes a macro as an argument.
This can be useful if you want the macro to do different things each
time it is invoked.

<p>For FizzBuzz we use a higher-order macro to tersely define all the
predicates in one place. What this macro actually does depends on the
macro name <i>p</i> that we pass to it.

<pre>
    #define predicates(p) \
        p(Fizz, i % 3 == 0) \
        p(Buzz, i % 5 == 0)
</pre>

<p>We can then define a function-defining macro, and pass it to our
higher-order macro to define all the predicate functions.

<pre>
    #define pred_fun(name, test) \
        static bool name(int i) { return test; }
    
    predicates(pred_fun)
</pre>

<p>And we can define a macro to declare a metadata table entry (using
the C preprocessor stringification operator), and pass it to our
higher-order macro to fill in the whole metadata table.

<pre>
    #define pred_ent(name, test) { name, #name },
    
    pred ptbl[] = {
        predicates(pred_ent)
    };
</pre>

<p>For the purposes of the main program we also need to declare the
end of the table.

<pre>
    #define ptbl_end (ptbl + sizeof(ptbl)/sizeof(*ptbl))
</pre>

<p>Higher-order macros can get unweildy, especially if each item in
the list is large. An alternative is to use a higher-order include
file, where instead of passing a macro to another macro,
you <tt>#define</tt> a macro with a particular name, <tt>#include</tt>
a file of macro invocations, then <tt>#undef</tt> the special macro.
This saves you from having to end dozens of lines with backslash
continuations.
